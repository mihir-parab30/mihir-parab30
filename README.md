# 👋 Hi, I'm Mihir Parab

I am a Master’s student in Data Analytics Engineering at Northeastern University, focused on building practical AI systems that make information more understandable, accessible, and actionable. My interests sit at the intersection of data engineering, MLOps, responsible AI, and public impact.

Right now, I’m working on end-to-end AI products that solve real problems: simplifying medical language for patients, forecasting public safety risk for city neighborhoods, and testing different ML deployment setups. I care about designing systems that are accurate, transparent, and easy for non-technical users to trust.

### 🔧 Current Focus Areas
- Building and deploying LLM-powered apps (healthcare + civic data)
- Time-series modeling and forecasting
- End-to-end pipelines (ingestion → ML training → API → UI)
- Responsible AI + human-in-the-loop design

### 📌 Featured Projects

| Project | Description | Tech |
|---|---|---|
| **LabLens** – AI Health Report Summarizer | Summarizing complex medical reports into plain language with multilingual support | FastAPI, Airflow, AWS S3, Docker, BioBERT, LangChain |
| **Public Safety Data Pipeline & Forecaster** | Forecasting neighborhood safety risk using Boston crime data to help newcomers evaluate safe areas | Pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, GCS, PostgreSQL, MLflow |
| **Titanic ML Pipeline** | Modeling survival with a modular ML workflow and Airflow scheduling | Airflow, scikit-learn, Docker |
| **MLOps Streamlit Lab** | Exploring interactive ML model UI and API deployment | Streamlit, FastAPI, Docker |

### 🎯 What I’m Looking For

Spring ’26 internship or co-op opportunities in:

- AI / ML Engineering  
- Data Engineering  
- Applied Machine Learning  
- Data Analytics
- Business Intelligence 

I’m especially interested in roles where AI is used to make real systems work better for people: healthcare, cities/government, education, and community services.
